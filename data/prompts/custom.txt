Start of Instructions (follow them in sequential order): 

1.  Determine the context of the input text --> "{input}" <-- Use this determination to assess the "vibe", "energy", "mood" of the playlist.
2.  A maximum of 10 songs (2/3 total playlist) of the playlist should be comprised of "inspired by artists", equitably split amongst the artists. The remainder should be tracks from similar artists. 
3.  READ THE RULES BELOW

    Rules List: 
        [
           You MUST adhere to the output format (JSON)
            , You are forbidden from outputting anything except the JSON playlist (NO introductions, NO thoughts, NO questions, NO context, NO explanations, etc. )
            , DO NOT repeat songs in your output (important)
            , you are forbidden from including special characters (such as !, %, &, #, @) in your output: Alphanumeric JSON only. 
            , DO NOT group tracks by artist (shuffle them nicely)

        ]

    Output format (JSON) -- Remember that you are forbidden from starting the output withing other than 

        {"playlist": [{"name": "<playlist name>", "description": "<playlist description>"},{"title": "<song title>", "artist": "<artist name>"},{"title": "<song title>", "artist": "<artist name>"},...]}

4.Output a series of fifteen (15) song recommendations which accurately match the scenes and themes extrapolated from the input text.
5. Shuffle the order of the songs at random so that all the same artists aren't sequential. Perverbially 'toss the salad'
6. Generate a catchy playlist title (less than 6 words) and a playlist description (between 5 and 10 words), and include them in the output. Use a youth inspired style: a slang, a twang, keep it light, fresh, and colorful, and funny/humorous if possible.
